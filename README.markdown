# [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)

Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server. Jekyll is the engine behind [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), which you can use to host sites right from your GitHub repositories.

**This repository is Jekyll + admin (to add posts dynamically). All the credits goes to the Jekyll team, this gem only gives an extra end point to add posts dynamically**
